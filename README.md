Before You Submit an Issue
----------------------------

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the other issues for this version [open](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/issues?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/issues?state=closed) to see if your issue already exists.
* Check the issues from the previous version (1.8) [open](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.8/issues?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.8/issues?state=closed) to see if your issue already exists.
* Check the [changelog](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/blob/master/changelog.md) to see if your issue has already been resolved.
* Please, please, please identify each issue by chapter, section, and subsection numbers. Since the content shifts around, and the PDF pages numbers do not match up with the book's, page numbers are next to useless.
* For tracking and credit purposes, **each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we'll close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.**

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we will alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.
